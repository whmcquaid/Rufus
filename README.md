Rufus

This is a program that takes in a file path to a local git repo as an argument and outputs some info about that repo

To try this program yourself:
* Make sure you have python installed.  If not visit [python.org](https://www.python.org) to download python and follow the instructions there to install
* If you don't have a code editor I recommend VSCode it's free.  Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Clone this repo to your computer
* Navigate to the repo in your terminal
* Use pip to install gitpython and pytz with these commands `pip install gitpython` and `pip install pytz`
* Open rufus.py in your code editor
* Uncomment the bottom line of code where the function is invoked and replace </sample/pathto/myrepo> with a file path to a local git repo
* Now you're almost there! Hit Run Python File - Play button - top right of VSCode
* You should see the expected output in the terminal if you put in a correct file path to a local repo or an error message if not
